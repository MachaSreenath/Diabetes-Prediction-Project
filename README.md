# Diabetes Prediction using SVM & AdaBoost

![Diabetes Image](frontpage.jpg)

Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction** project! This project utilizes **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **AdaBoost** classifiers to predict diabetes based on various health indicators. The goal is to achieve accurate predictions using **Python**, essential machine learning libraries, and a **Flask**-based interactive web application.

## Features

- Developed an **SVM model** and an **AdaBoost model** for diabetes prediction using **scikit-learn**.
- Achieved high accuracy with **standardized data processing**.
- Utilized **NumPy** and **Pandas** for efficient data handling.
- Implemented a **Flask-based web application** for real-time predictions.
- Integrated **StandardScaler** for feature scaling.
- Provided medication suggestions for diabetic patients.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

- Use the **Flask web application** to input patient details and get predictions.
- Check out the trained **SVM and AdaBoost models** stored in the script.
- The system provides medication suggestions if the prediction is positive.
